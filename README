Blackbird Render Engine
====================

Blackbird is a ray tracing renderer focused on interactivity and ease of use, while
still supporting many production features.

Blackbird is a fork of the Cycles render engine by the Blender Foudation:

= Building =
------------

== Requirements ==
-------------------

Crucial dependencies:
- OpenGL
- GLEW
- Boost (version at least 1.48).
- OpenImageIO (plus all the libraries which OIIO depends on).
- PugiXML unless OpenImageIO is compiled with embedded version of this library.
- Embree

Optional dependencies:
- OpenShadingLanguage
- OpenImageDenoise
- CUDA
- OptiX

== Precompiled libraries ==
---------------------------

It is possible to use precompiled libraries for OSX and Windows The libraries could
be checked out from Blender's library repository:

  https://svn.blender.org/svnroot/bf-blender/trunk/lib/

Currently the full checkout of platform libraries is required. This means, i.e.,
to use OSX libraries this folder is to be checked out:

  https://svn.blender.org/svnroot/bf-blender/trunk/lib/darwin-9.x.universal/

Build system expects precompiled libraries to be stored in the lib/ folder next
to folder with Cycles sources.

== Compilation Options ==
-------------------------

- WITH_CPU_SSE                  // Enable SIMD instruction if they're detected on
                                // the host machine.
- WITH_CYCLES_STANDALONE_GUI    // Build standalone app with GUI.
- WITH_CYCLES_OSL               // Build with OpenShadingLanguage support.
- WITH_CYCLES_LOGGING           // Build with logging support.
- WITH_CYCLES_DEBUG             // Build with extra debug capabilities.

== Compilation ==
------------------

Once all the requirements are met, either invoke `cmake` with all desired
parameters from a build folder, or simply type `make` in the root directory of
Blackbird repository.

== Extra Dependencies ==
------------------------

Depending on how the dependencies were compiles it is possible that manual tweaks
to the linker are required.

For example if OpenImageIO is compiled as a static library it'll be required to
pass all the OIIO dependencies to the linker using  CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS CMake
variable.

Dealing with such kind of dependencies is not really possible automatically, so
we can't reduce entropy of a hassle here.

It is possible to pass CMake configuration arguments to GNU Makefile, i.e.:

  make BUILD_CMAKE_ARGS="-DBOOST_ROOT=/opt/lib/boost"

= Known Limitations =
---------------

- GPU rendering in Blackbrd is largely untested and may not be working
- Blackbird is intended to be used with hdBlackbird and may not work in other applications
